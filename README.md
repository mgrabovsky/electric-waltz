Electric Waltz is an extremely simplified model of the Czech electric transmission system.

## History

A first version of this model was devised by Jan Rovensk√Ω and implemented in an Excel spreadsheet. This project is a rewrite of that model in Python which provides greater flexibility and maintainability. It makes the model easier to expand and customise.
